dotfiles
============

Configurations and optimisations for Zsh, Git, Neovim, Hyper, etc.

Please be aware that _these configurations are designed for my own personal use_. You are of course welcome to make use of whatever you find here, but do understand that I take no responsibility for anything that backfires on your machine. (Thereâ€™s really nothing scary in here. Just a word of caution.)

## Whatâ€™s included

### Zsh and Git
I use [Zgen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage my ZSH plugins, because it is awesome. Zgen is sourced and applied (and relevant plugins are called) all from the .zshrc file. It is installed as a submodule of this repo.

The `gitconfig` included is primarily borrowed from YADR, and includes some sensible aliases and defaults for Gitâ€™s CLI. **User-specific Git configurations should be stored in ~/.gitconfig.user**.

Also provided are a small number of convenient Zsh aliases â€” [take a look at them here](https://github.com/colepeters/dotfiles/blob/master/aliases.zsh).

Please note that:
- any private info (e.g. API tokens, etc) should be stored in a `~/.secrets` file, which is sourced automatically if it exists
- any private aliases (e.g. server ssh logins, etc) should be stored in a `~/.aliases.user.zsh`, which is also sourced automatically if it exists

### Neovim
Neovim is like Vim, but (in my humble opinion) better. I particularly love its asynchronous plugin architecture, how fast its development community is growing, and how well maintenance and support is handled. I keep my configuration pretty lean.

## Usage (macOS)
These instructions have been tested on my own machine (OS X 10.12.5, using the latest version of [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) and/or [Hyper](https://hyper.is)). They presume that you do **not** already have a `.dotfiles/` directory in your user (`~/`) directory.

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
1. Correct Hombrew permissions: `sudo chown -R "$USER":admin /usr/local && sudo chown -R "$USER":admin /Library/Caches/Homebrew`
1. Install [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Install non-system version of Python: `brew install python && brew install python3` (also installs Pip which is required)
1. Install [Neovim](https://neovim.io)
1. Install Ag (`brew install ag`) in order for FZF to work with the default command
1. Install Pure (`npm install -g pure-prompt`)

### Install

```shell
# Install Zsh
brew install zsh

# Add zsh to standard shells
sudo vi /etc/shells              # Add /usr/local/bin/zsh to the end of this file

# Switch into Zsh â€” donâ€™t worry if it looks like crap for the moment
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh

# Clone the repo to into a ".dotfiles" directory in your user directory
git clone git@github.com:colepeters/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# Switch to the new directory
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Initialise and update Zgen submodule
git submodule init && git submodule update

# Install RCM
brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
brew install rcm

# Copy the RCM config file to your ~ directory first
rcup -v rcrc

# Generate symlinked dotfiles in your ~ directory
rcup -v
```

### Additional packages
Some aliases and configurations depend on these little packages to work:

```shell
# Some Neovim packages require Neovim with `if_python3`
pip3 install neovim

# JS completion requires ternjs (configured in tern-config dotfile)
npm i -g tern

# diff-so-fancy, for better git diffs:
npm i -g diff-so-fancy

# Tig, a Git CLI wrapper:
brew install tig

# HTTPie, a nice cURL replacement:
brew install httpie
```

### Optional add-ons
Some of the other CLI tools I use on a regular basis are listed in [npm\_global\_installs.txt](https://github.com/colepeters/dotfiles/blob/master/npm-global-installs.txt)

### ðŸŽ‰ Ta-da
You should now be able to open a new shell session and have everything be not horrible and hopefully cooler and ready to go.

Worh repeating:
- any private info (e.g. GitHub tokens, etc) should be stored in a `~/.secrets` file, which is sourced automatically if it exists
- any private aliases (e.g. server ssh logins, etc) should be stored in a `~/.aliases.user.zsh`, which is also sourced automatically if it exists

## Credits
The dotfiles are managed with [rcm by Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm), which is an awesome, lightweight tool for keeping dotfiles synced and organised.

Some Zsh and Git configurations have been borrowed from the [YADR dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) repository. I have attempted to make mention of all of these instances within the code to give credit where it is due.
